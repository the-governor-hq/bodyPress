///
/// Fields are designed for multi-day pattern correlation:
/// - **Temporal dimensions**: timeOfDay, dayType enable day-part analysis
/// - **Activity context**: activityCategory normalizes activity states
/// - **Location context**: locationContext identifies place types
/// - **Wellness scores**: sleepQuality, stressLevel enable numeric trends
/// - **Pattern hints**: patternHints are AI-discovered correlations
