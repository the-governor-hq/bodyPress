# Changelog

All notable changes to BodyPress Flutter will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.21] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **ADS1299 multi-sample BLE packets**: Parser now correctly handles 120-byte notifications (5 batched samples × 8 channels × 3 bytes) instead of only reading the first 24 bytes and discarding the rest — 5× effective sample throughput at 250 SPS
- Timestamps within a batch are evenly spaced based on sample rate for accurate time-domain rendering

### Changed

- `BleSourceProvider.parseNotification` return type changed from `SignalSample?` to `List<SignalSample>` to support multi-sample BLE packets
- `BleSourceService` listener iterates over all returned samples per notification

## [1.0.20] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Real-time Spectral Analysis (BCI)**: Pure-Dart Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT engine (`FftEngine`) with Hanning window, PSD normalisation, and EEG frequency band extraction (Delta δ 0.5–4 Hz, Theta θ 4–8, Alpha α 8–13, Beta β 13–30, Gamma γ 30–100)
- **Bioluminescent Spectrum widget** (`SpectralAnalysisChart`) — three views: live frequency spectrum with triple-pass glow rendering, scrolling waterfall spectrogram with 7-stop bioluminescent gradient heatmap, and animated EEG band power meters
- **BCI Decoding view** (`BciDecodingView`) — demo neural state classifier: 5-state model (Focus, Relax, Motor-L, Motor-R, Meditate), animated confidence ring, probability bars per state, scrolling classification timeline ribbon. Pseudo-classification derived from signal RMS/variance
- **BCI Monitoring view** (`BciMonitoringView`) — demo signal quality dashboard: per-channel SNR (dB), RMS amplitude (µV), simulated impedance (kΩ), artifact detection (clean / blink / muscle / movement), overall data-readiness score gauge, artifact timeline painter
- **4-mode signal view system** — `SignalViewMode` enum (`Waveform`, `Spectral`, `Decoding`, `Monitor`) replaces the old spectral toggle; `PopupMenuButton` mode picker in the AppBar with per-mode icons, colours, and "DEMO" badge on decoding/monitoring; `AnimatedSwitcher` crossfade between all four views
- Dominant frequency badge, pulsing aurora icon, per-channel selector, smoothed PSD bars (EMA α=0.3), 75% FFT overlap for smooth updates
- Comprehensive FFT test suite (12 tests): sinusoid peak detection, band power extraction, Parseval energy conservation, white noise flatness, dB normalisation, frequency axis validation

## [1.0.18] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Barcode Nutrition Scanner**: Scan any food product barcode from the Capture screen to log its nutritional profile — Nutri-Score, NOVA group, full macro breakdown (energy, protein, carbs, sugars, fat, fiber, salt) per 100 g and per serving

- Nutrition summary card in the Capture sensor panel showing all scanned products with remove/add-more controls

- `═══ NUTRITION / FOOD SCANS ═══` section in AI metadata prompt with Nutri-Score, NOVA group descriptions, per-100 g and per-serving macros
- DB schema v10 migration: `nutrition_data` TEXT column on `captures` table + `nutrition_logs` table with indexes on `scanned_at` and `capture_id`
- CRUD methods in `LocalDbService`: `saveNutritionLog`, `loadNutritionLogsForCapture`, `loadRecentNutritionLogs`
